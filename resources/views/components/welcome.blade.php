            This project focuses on the design and implementation of an Access Control and Authentication system for a web-based application. The system is developed to ensure secure user management, protect data integrity, and comply with established security standards.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
            Key components of the system include Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced login security, and a secure token-based authentication mechanism for session management. Biometric authentication will also be integrated where applicable to provide additional security options.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-4">
            To support system monitoring and reliability, the project incorporates Audit Trails and Logging to track user and system activities, as well as Data Backups to ensure data recovery in case of failure. These features work together to provide a structured and secure approach to user access and data protection.
